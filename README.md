# Intensive School of Virology UniPV - Virtual Lab on SARS-CoV-2 genome bioinformatics

This repository contains data and intermediate files for SARS-CoV-2 variant calling exercises.
We believe in standards, both in research and education, and therefore we have used datasets common to the work carried out by the nf-core community.
